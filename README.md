This is a web app that allows you to search for audiobooks on Audible.com. You can filter by genre, rating, length, price, and more. You can also view the details and reviews of each audiobook.

# Why I made this
I was not satisfied with the default search options on Audible.com, so I decided to make my own. I wanted to have more control and flexibility over how I find and discover new audiobooks.

# How it works
This web app uses Python and Flask to scrape data from Audible.com and store it in a SQLite database. It then uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the results in a user-friendly interface. You can access the web app at https://audible-search.vercel.app/.

# How to use it
To use this web app, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install the required packages using the command pip install -r requirements.txt. Then, you can run the webapp.py file using the command python webapp.py. This will launch a local server that you can access at http://localhost:5000/.

Alternatively, you can deploy this web app to a hosting service like Vercel or Heroku. You will need to create an account and follow their instructions on how to deploy a Python Flask app.

# Feedback and contributions
I welcome any feedback or suggestions on how to improve this web app. You can contact me at saketthakur001@gmail.com or open an issue or pull request on this repository.
